# Design and implementation of an (hybrid) app to support university life

Project realized for the course *Mobile Programming* at *Universit√† Politecnica delle Marche*. 
 

 - Development of an *hybrid* application with *Xamarin* (MVVM design pattern), using *Visual Studio* and *C#* as  programming language.
 - The application manages the activities of a university student.
 - The same app was realized as a native Android app with *Android Studio* and *Java* ([Android app](https://github.com/denaldo98/AppAndroidStudio))

NOTE: The app was implemented only for the Android version, since we were not able to test the code for IOS.

## Development steps:
 - Requirement analysis (functional and non functional)
 * Design: application map and mockups, database design and implementation (Firebase Firestore)
 * C# implementation in Visual Studio
 
 All the details of the development (including UML diagrams, mockups and screenshots of the running application) are shown in the provided [report](https://github.com/denaldo98/AppXamarin/blob/master/Relazione%20Mobile.pdf) file.
